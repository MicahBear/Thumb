## Philosophy

Building an PWA (first) growing calendar for gardeners, homesteaders, and farmers of all experience level. Growing calendar based on frost dates that will display best average time to seed, transplant, and harvest your plant babies.
I want to provide a resource for people to allow for less friction of growing your own food.
